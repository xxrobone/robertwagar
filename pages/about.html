            <p>
                I'm a Dad to two beautiful boys, I'm a developer & I'm a dancer(dance teacher)</br>
                Most of my life I been working with dancing, teaching, performing, organizing, helping schools to find
                the right teachers,
                set schedules, worked with non profit assosiations and inpired the youth and kids to move their bodies,
                to what i consider is good music.

            <p>
                <br>
                I studied frontend development at KYH in Stockholm, & now Im actually studying again, with focus on
                frontend and app development at CME.
                <br>
                With that said I also done and internship at Addcode from nov 2021 - april 2022 with most focus on
                Wordpress, ACF, Less, using their own wp framework/ template, adding plugins etc, doing
                changes on their customers websites, I also re-built a new frontend from a figma design to one of their customers.
                <br>
                One of my bigger solo projects was done for LockerLegends international, you can find this on the
                projects section <a href="../index.html#projects">here</a>

            <p>
                So working with creativity and artforms has helped me a lot in my life to find sollutions, and now when
                I'm coding I see the similarities
                between the two.
                <br>
                There is a saying - ALWAYS A STUDENT in otherwords always be open to learn new, so this is what I saw in
                code and was like ok, maybe not the same
                vocabulary, but the same thought somehow. <br>
                I'm interested... <br>
                now been developing, learning and working with this for a few years.

                fast forwards, I dident have a computer for many years, but always wondered If I could do it

            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">Inspiration Ideas Creativity</h2>
            <p> I'm always looking for creative solutions in everythings life.
                Without creativity we would be standing still, and to inspire other to find and learn new things, is one
                of
                the hightlight of my life. I love seeing others reach their goals and make their dreams come true.
                That's
                why I'm happy that I in my carreer as a dance teacher have succeeded in doing so, inspiring new
                generations <br>
                & now looking forward to help new developers in the future</p>
