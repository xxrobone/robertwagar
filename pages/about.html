            <p>
                I'm a Dad to two beautiful boys, I'm a developer & I'm a dancer(dance teacher)</br>
                I got two professions and both are also my hobbies,
                I have the opportunity to be creative, this is what i love about coding at the same time solving peoples problems by finding the best sollutions for their needs. <br>
                Before coding came to my life...
                I been working with artforms within dance "world", teaching, performing, organizing, helping schools to
                find
                the right teachers,
                set schedules, worked with differnt projects, also with non profit assosiations and inpired the youth
                and kids to move their bodies,
                to what i consider is good music.

            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">Inspiration Ideas Creativity</h2>
            <p> I'm always looking for creative solutions in everythings life.
                Without creativity we would be standing still, and to inspire other to find and learn new things, is one
                of
                the hightlight of my life. I love seeing others reach their goals and make their dreams come true.
                That's
                why I'm happy that I in my carreer as a dance teacher have succeeded in doing so, inspiring new
                generations & in coding helping people get their ideas to life, now also in the future looking forward to help new developers</p>

            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">Creativity art design and technology</h2>
            <p>I belive that these skills with the right mindset & in the right hands, is the 'tools' to solve our
                future problems.
                We should always thrive to find new and better ways, and keep in mind that we are creative beings if
                allowed to develop those abilities.
                When not learning new & teaching I try to keep up with whats going on in the world of code and design.

            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">Coding jouney so far...</h2>
            <p>
                I studied frontend development at KYH in Stockholm, & now Im actually studying again, with focus on
                frontend and app development at CME.
                <br>
                With that said I also done and internship at Addcode from nov 2021 - april 2022 with most focus on
                Wordpress, ACF, Less, using their own wp framework/ template, adding plugins etc, doing
                changes on their customers websites, I also re-built a new frontend from a figma design to one of their
                customers.
                <br>
                One of my bigger solo projects was done for LockerLegends international, you can find this on the
                projects section <a href="./projects.html#p1">here</a>

            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">Dance and code? Connection?</h2>
            <p>
                So working with creativity and artforms has helped me a lot in my life to find solutions, and now when
                I'm coding I see the similarities
                between the two. If there is a problem, find a solution.
                <br>
                In the artform of Hip-Hop I many times say - ALWAYS A STUDENT in otherwords always be open to learn new,
                so this is what I saw in
                programming, and it might not be the same
                vocabulary, but the same thought somehow. <br>
                I was interested... <br>
                now been developing, learning new as I go and working with this for a few years.
