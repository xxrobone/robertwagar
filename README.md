# PORTFOLIO
## Assignment - 5

(this project is a pure html, css vanilla js / jquery project, i start with mobile first so if it looks strange I havent worked on desktop yet, i will change this many times, so check back later if it looks awefull)

So our 5th assignment is to create a portfolio
so i've gathered everything i learned and 
tried out so far

I will use file structure from assignment 1
first page from assitnemnt 3 as my hero section
and some more

I will use some libraries might use Jquery for nav just to add a little what ive done testing with jQuery

- open close button js
- nav desktop - mobile (will be multilevel)
- animations effect js / 2 different
- color generator for one page
- will work on this then add more
