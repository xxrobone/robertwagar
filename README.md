# PORTFOLIO
## Assignment - 5


So our 5th assignment is to create a portfolio
so i've gathered everything i learned and 
tried out so far

I choose to do the project in "vanilla" js, html , css, anime.js (as my "plugin")

### Issues, thoughts, fixes

- css is fun, not too hard &
at the same time not easy at all, can get messy ;)

- I understand why people use bootstrap and tailwind, to work faster and have pre set styling. 

- Text effect using javascript was a challendge its not perfect but its working

- Animations, keyframes and transitions is too much fun
could spend our on this, love it. 
Anime.js is a awesome library, should definitly check it out. 
Animations makes the pages come alive. 
Definitly need to get better and deep dive at one point

- i work in separate project testing before adding, i like this, i could just do  more branches, but I kind of like having it locally for now. Probably will add branches so i can keep some ideas and test online

## navigations dropdown

I've took a try to make it dynamic (got a challenge from Alexis), I also host one on codepen and you can find this in my navigations repo. 
It is not 100% dynamic, but on its way. 


## Project tech
Using only html, css and js and anime.js
